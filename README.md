OpenIVA is an end-to-end intelligent video analytics development toolkit based on different inference backends, which implements varied mainstream facial recognition, object detection, tracking and keypoint detection algorithms in modular design.
# Features
1. Multi inference backends
- Surpport TensorlayerX/TensorRT/onnxruntime
2. Asynchronous & multithreading
- Use multithreading and queue to reach high device utilization for inference and pre/post-processing
3. Lightweight service
- Use Flask for lightweight intelligent application services
